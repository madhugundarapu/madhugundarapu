## 🚀 What I do 
I build cloud-native, production-ready systems for startups and SMEs: migrations, infra as code, CI/CD, containerization, and ML deployment. I focus on quick delivery, security, and operational simplicity.

**Services I offer**
- Cloud migrations & architecture (AWS)  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform + modular patterns  
- CI/CD pipelines: GitHub Actions / Jenkins / Docker → Kubernetes/ECS  
- Containerize & Deploy ML models (Flask/FastAPI + Docker + ECR/ECS)  
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus / Grafana / CloudWatch)

## 🎯 Featured Projects (client-style)


### Project: Static Site → S3 (example)
**Problem:** Client needed a reliable, low-cost marketing site with CI/CD.  
**Solution:** Static site (HTML/CSS) stored in S3 + CloudFront; GitHub Actions for CI deploy; IAM role with least privilege.  
**Outcome:** 99.9% uptime, $X/month hosting, deploys on push to `main`.  
**Tech:** AWS S3, CloudFront, GitHub Actions, IAM, Route53.
